# Setup Environment â€“ Cyber Security

## Virtual Machines
- Install **VirtualBox** or **VMware Workstation**  
- Create separate VMs for **attacker (Kali Linux)** and **victim (Windows/Linux)**  

## Tools to Install
- Kali Linux with pre-installed penetration testing tools  
- Wireshark for traffic monitoring  
- Nmap for network scanning  
- Burp Suite Community Edition for web testing  

## Best Practices
- Use isolated network mode (Host-only/Bridged)  
- Take VM snapshots before testing  
- Do not connect vulnerable machines directly to the internet
