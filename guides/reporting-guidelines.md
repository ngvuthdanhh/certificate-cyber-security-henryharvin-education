# Reporting Guidelines – Cyber Security

## Structure of a Report
1. **Executive Summary** – High-level overview for management  
2. **Scope & Methodology** – Systems tested and testing methods used  
3. **Findings** – Detailed vulnerabilities with evidence (screenshots, logs)  
4. **Impact Assessment** – Potential damage if exploited  
5. **Recommendations** – Steps to fix vulnerabilities  
6. **Appendices** – Tools, references, additional notes  

## Best Practices
- Be clear and concise  
- Use screenshots to support findings  
- Suggest prioritized remediation steps  
- Avoid technical jargon for executive reports
